// Package decorator includes a simple "Decorator" pattern for golang. The implementation takes
// advantage of golang struct embedding to extend the capabilities of the "Condiment" decorators.
// Unlike Java or other object-oriented languages, effective struct embedding requires the "base"
// struct to be exported and useful.
